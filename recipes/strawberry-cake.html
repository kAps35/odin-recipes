        <h1>Strawberry Cake</h1>
        <p>This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree and strawberry gelatin. This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a caterer. I made this cake for a child's birthday party and it was a major hit! Frost with cream cheese frosting or chocolate ganache for a special treat.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®</li>
            <li>4 large eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 ¾ cups sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
            <li>½ cup strawberry puree</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk.</li>
            <li>Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
