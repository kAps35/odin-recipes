        <h1>Beef Stroganoff</h1>
            <p>This beef stroganoff is made with beef chuck roast, beef broth, white wine, mushrooms, and sour cream. 
                It is the best I've ever had and well worth the effort. I have been making this recipe for over 20 years! 
                Serve over rice or noodles.
            </p>
